# Crowdfunding_ETL
Project 2 Crowdfunding ETL

Create a new database in pgAdmin and then right click the newly created database -> "Restore...".
Make sure to be looking at all file types while loading files and select "crowdfunding_db.backup".
Then "Restore" the database.
Tables should be imported and filled with the csv data.

Open new queries to load schema file used to create tables and load the tables.

When choosing the two options for extracting and transforming the data from the contacts.xlsx Excel data, I wanted to try out both methods of using Python dictionary methods and regular expressions. Both options works.
